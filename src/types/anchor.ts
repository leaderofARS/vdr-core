/**
 * @module types/anchor
 *
 * @description
 * TypeScript type definitions for anchoring operations.
 *
 * ## Types
 *
 * ### `AnchorStatus`
 * Union of possible anchor lifecycle states:
 * - `'pending'`   — Transaction submitted, awaiting Solana confirmation.
 * - `'confirmed'` — Supermajority of validators have voted on this block.
 * - `'failed'`    — Transaction was rejected or dropped.
 * - `'revoked'`   — Anchor was explicitly revoked by the issuing organisation.
 *
 * ### `AnchorOptions`
 * Input to `sipheron.anchor()` or `anchorToSolana()`. Supply **either** a
 * `file` Buffer (hashed locally before transmission) **or** a pre-computed
 * `hash` string — never both.
 *
 * ### `AnchorResult`
 * Returned by all anchoring methods. Contains the transaction signature,
 * PDA address, Solana Explorer URL, and a public verification URL.
 *
 * ### `BatchAnchorOptions` / `BatchAnchorResult`
 * Used by `sipheron.anchorBatch()` to process up to 500 documents
 * in a single call, with per-document success/failure tracking.
