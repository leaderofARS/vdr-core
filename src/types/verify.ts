/**
 * @module types/verify
 *
 * @description
 * TypeScript type definitions for verification operations.
 *
 * ## Types
 *
 * ### `VerifyOptions`
 * Input to `sipheron.verify()` or `verifyHashStandalone()`.
 * Supply **either** `file` (hashed locally and never transmitted) **or** a
 * pre-computed `hash` string — never both.
 *
 * ### `VerificationStatus`
 * The detailed outcome of a verification attempt:
 * - `'authentic'`  — Hash found on-chain AND anchor status is `'confirmed'`.
 * - `'mismatch'`   — A record exists but the hash does not match.
 * - `'not_found'`  — No anchor record found for this hash.
 * - `'revoked'`    — Anchor exists but has been explicitly revoked.
 * - `'pending'`    — Anchor exists but transaction not yet confirmed.
 *
 * ### `VerificationResult`
 * Return value of all `verify*` methods. The boolean `authentic` field is the
 * fast-path check; inspect `status` for the full picture.
